# Recipe List:  A New York Times API Project

## What is this?

Recipe List was a project for me to get more comfortable working with state in React and an API.  Currently it lists articles from the New York Times food section, which can be clicked on to read.  Its a recipe for success!

## How do I use it?
1. Clone or fork this repo.
2. Install the repo using `npm i`.
3. Get things up and running with `npm start`.

## Is this hosted anywhere?
Not yet!

## What are the future plans for Recipe List?
1. Create a favoriting system.
2. Work on creating a sort by date, favorites.
3. Really nail that responsiveness.
